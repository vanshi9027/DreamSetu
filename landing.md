You've successfully installed React Router.

✅ react-router-dom installed

This is our first external library for DreamSetu.

📊 Sprint 1.2 Progress
Task	Status
Remove Vite Demo	⏳
Understand React Flow	⏳
Install Tailwind CSS	⏳
Install React Router	✅
Professional Folder Structure	⏳
🧠 Before We Continue...

I noticed I gave you Tailwind instructions that may not match the latest version. I don't want to teach you outdated practices.

We'll install Tailwind CSS v4 (the current version), which is simpler than older tutorials.

🚀 Step 1: Install Tailwind

Run:

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

When it's done, tell me:

"Installed"

Don't change any files yet.

📚 Why Tailwind?

Suppose you want to make a blue button.

Traditional CSS
.button {
  background: blue;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}

Then:

<button class="button">Login</button>
Tailwind
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white px-5 py-2 rounded-lg">
  Login
</button>

No separate CSS file.

This makes development much faster, especially in hackathons.

🎯 After Installation

We'll configure three files together:

vite.config.ts
index.css
App.tsx

I'll explain every line.

📁 Next: Professional Folder Structure

After Tailwind is working, we'll create this structure:

src/
│
├── assets/
├── components/
│   ├── common/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── ui/
├── pages/
│   ├── Landing/
│   ├── Auth/
│   ├── Dashboard/
│   └── Assessment/
├── routes/
├── services/
├── hooks/
├── context/
├── utils/
├── constants/
├── types/
├── styles/
├── App.tsx
├── main.tsx
└── index.css

Notice something important:

We are not creating these folders just because "everyone does."

Each folder solves a specific problem. Before creating each one, I'll explain:

Why does it exist?
What will we store there?
What happens if we don't have it?
How does it connect to the rest of DreamSetu?

That's how professional engineers think.

🎯 Your Current Task

Run:

npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite

Reply with "Installed", and then we'll configure Tailwind together using the latest setup. From that point onward, we'll start building DreamSetu's actual UI instead of just configuring tools.

Excellent! 🎉

Now we officially enter Day 1 - Professional Frontend Setup.

Current Progress:

✅ React + TypeScript
✅ React Router
✅ Tailwind Installed
⏳ Configure Tailwind
⏳ Clean Vite
⏳ Create Architecture
Step 1 — Configure Tailwind

Open:

vite.config.ts

Show me its current content.

It should look similar to:

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins:
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'
// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    react(),
    tailwindcss(),

  ],
})

Absolutely. Since we have limited time, today we will finish the complete Landing Page.

But we won't code blindly.

We will spend 30–45 minutes designing, then 2–3 hours building. This is much faster than redesigning later.

🎯 Today's Goal

By tonight, DreamSetu should have a professional landing page.

What judges should feel

Within 10 seconds, they should understand:

✅ What DreamSetu is
✅ What problem it solves
✅ Why it is different
✅ How it works
✅ Why they should care
